# Tridactyl

A pair programming project with my peer Marie-Anne that decoded a tridactyl-encoded text file. The first line of the text file has the "master password" used to create the decoding algorithm. The other lines of the file have text that was encoded also using the same "master password."

Use the provided text files to test the decoding!
